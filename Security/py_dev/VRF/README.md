# Verifiable-Random-Functions

We implemented RSA VRF on Python3.5 fulfilling the properties of trusted uniqueness, trusted collision resistance, and full pseudorandomness.

USAGE: python RSA_VRF.py [alpha]

This code takes alpha and generates a proof and then proceeds to verify it. You can modify the size of the proof by modifying the variable k.
